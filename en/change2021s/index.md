## Zoom/Webex Made Accessible for UTokyo Account
{:#zoom_webex}
For the use of web conferencing tools such as **Zoom and Webex**, ECCS cloud email (1234567890@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp) and its password were previously indispensable. This is however no longer necessary. **Logging in with UTokyo Account is now possible**.
Your current account is scheduled to be transferred to your UTokyo Account in mid-March. Details will be announced on this page in due course.

## Implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to UTokyo Account
{:#mfa}
To enhance data security, **multi-factor authentication** is to be introduced to UTokyo Accounts logins after April 2021. Once multi-factor authentication is set up,  a phone/SNS verification code is required for login. Details will be announced on this page in due course.

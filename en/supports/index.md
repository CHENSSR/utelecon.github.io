<div style="border: 2px solid currentcolor; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">To expand our support services for the new academic year, we have introduced a new support desk which is co-operated by the student staff ("common supporters") and faculty members.</div>

* This page aims to respond to various inquiries related to online classes and web conferences from students and faculties of the University of Tokyo. 
* Normally, student staff (i.e. common supporters) will respond to your inquiry, but it might be handed over to faculty members when deemed necessary.
* You might contact us through chats, Zoom, and email form. For consultation, please pick any means that is of your convenience.

## Regulations

* To ensure prompt response, each support desk is generally staffed by students. Please keep this in mind and **DO NOT include any information which is inappropriate to share with students.**
* If you have a question that is inappropriate for students, such as a question about your grades, **please check the "I would like to receive support from faculty members" box on the email form. A faculty member will respond directly.** However, please understand that it may take time in such cases.
* **If you have any questions or concerns about examinations, please first contact your instructor or the department/graduate school that offers the examinations.** Regarding examinations, we only accept inquiries from the email form.
* For support via Zoom, we do not record voices or videos. **Users are also requested not to do any recording or video recording**.
* Information obtained from inquiries will be used for replying and related tasks, and may also be shared internally to improve support services in the future. In addition, they may be disclosed in the form of case studies and statistical information, etc., for the purpose of introducing support initiatives in a manner that prevents identification of individuals. We will not use the information for any other purposes except for the exceptions specified by law.
* Student staff, who signed confidentiality agreements, handle the information under the control and supervision of faculty staff.
* Please note that it may take some time to receive responses from the operators through chats and Zoom, depending on how busy they are. Under such circumstances, please contact us with the email form or try again later.
* If you leave the chat page, you may not be able to receive messages from the operator. Please do not close the chat page during the exchange.

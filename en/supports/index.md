## Chat Support
* About this service
  * Please click the “ “ shown at the right bottom corner of this page to start.
  * First, the chatbot (auto-replying robot) will ask you questions. Please answer the questions using the given choices.
  * When it is difficult to solve your problem by the chatbot, you will be connected to the operator. 
   * Before connecting to the operator, you will be asked to write your name, affiliation, etc. Please follow the instructions and fill in the demanded information. 
  * If your problem couldn’t be solved by the Chat Support, please go on to the recommended support desk.
* Precautions 
  * In this Chat Support, student operators (called “common supporters”) will answer you when in need. Please understand that there is a limit to the number of people the operators can assist at the same time.   
    * As the operators are students and not professors, the Chat Support basically doesn’t answer questions about exams. If you have questions or something to consult about exams, please contact the teacher, faculty or department in charge.
  * The operators are basically available from 8:30 to18:35 (JST) on weekdays. However, please understand that unavailable time might occur due to work shift gaps. (Chat Support by the chatbot is available 24hours.)
  * When many people demand support by the operator at once, you might not be able to reach the operator. Please try again after sometime, or use the Support by Email. 
  * All questions and comments during the Chat Support are recorded.
  * Please be careful when handling your personal information. To be specific, please DO NOT write your UTokyo Account (10 digit), student ID, age, or gender in the Chat Support System.
  * When personal information as mentioned above is necessary to solve your problem, the operator will guide you to the Support by Email. Please follow the instructions at Support by Email and contact us by email.
  * The building of the chatbot and the response to the chats are mainly handled by Japanese speaking students. We apologize if there are any incorrect or confusing expressions (if any, please inform us). Also, please forgive us if we do not have students who can speak English fluently at certain times of the day.

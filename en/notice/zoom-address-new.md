title: Signing in to Zoom with a non-UTokyo ID
---
Due to system changes, **signing in to UTokyo Zoom using non-UTokyo IDs will no longer be available**.  

**Non-UTokyo IDs that will be disabled include ECCS Cloud Emails setup with the username of your choice `xxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`**.  
Users of such accounts will need to switch to their **10-digit UTokyo ID issued by UTokyo**.

Please follow the instructions on this page to switch to your UTokyo ID.

## How to Sign in after the System Change for Spring 2021
{:#treatment-in-change2021s}

You can continue to sign into Zoom with your non-UTokyo ID after the System Change for Spring 2021 using the previous sign-in method. Please visit the usual Zoom sign-in page, [https://zoom.us/signin](https://zoom.us/signin), and enter your email address (e.g. your ECCS Cloud Email, `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`) and password to sign in.

However, you cannot sign in with your non-UTokyo ID using the new sign-in method. After the system changeover on March 15, 2021, an UTokyo Zoom Account using your UTokyo ID is newly created. With this new UTokyo Account, you can use the new sign-in method.
Your meeting information (meeting room information, cloud recording information, etc.) and settings will not be transferred to the new UTokyo Zoom account. **If you cannot find any of the previously saved meeting information or settings, you are likely signed into the new UTokyo Account**. To access data from your old account, sign out of the current account, go to the usual Zoom sign-in page at [https://zoom.us/signin](https://zoom.us/signin), and sign in with the old non-UTokyo Account’s email address and password.

## Switching to the 10-digit UTokyo ID
{:#change-procedure}

Signing into UTokyo Zoom with non-UTokyo IDs (such as ECCS Cloud Email, `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`) will soon be completely disabled.
**Please follow the steps below to switch to your UTokyo Account with the 10-digit UTokyo ID as soon as possible**.

### If you no longer need your non-UTokyo Account
{:#existing-account-is-unnecessary}
If your current non-UTokyo Zoom account is no longer necessary, you can just start using the new UTokyo Account with the 10-digit UTokyo ID.
Please follow the instructions on the “[Sign-in Methods for Zoom](/en/zoom/zoom_signin.html)” page to sign in with the 10-digit UTokyo ID.

The administrator will help delete your non-UTokyo Zoom Account. Please submit [the UTokyo Zoom Unnecessary Account Declaration Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=T6978HAr10eaAgh1yvlMhHUY5ws7h1xGr9koV-KGC8RUNTBGSjJPN0ZWN0RIVFI2TVZZODZNT0xRRy4u).


### If you want to transfer data to your new UTokyo Account
{:#change-email-of-existing-account}
If you want to transfer your old non-UTokyo account data (e.g. conference room information, cloud recordings, Zoom settings) to the new UTokyo Account, please follow the steps below to change your sign-in email address.

1. Go to your [Zoom profile page](https://zoom.us/profile) (or sign in if you have not), and click "Edit" on the right side of the "Sign-in Email" field.<br> ![](image/zoom-signinaddress.png)
1. Enter your UTokyo email address with the 10-digit UTokyo ID (e.g. <code>1234567890@<em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>) as your new email address.<br>![](image/zoom-signinaddress-confirm.png)
1. An email will be sent to your ECCS Cloud Email. Click on the confirmation button in the email to complete the process.

If you see the message **"The email address "1234567890@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp" is already in use"**, an account using "<code>1234567890@<em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>" already exists and needs to be deleted. Please fill out and submit [the Zoom Account Delete Request Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=T6978HAr10eaAgh1yvlMhHUY5ws7h1xGr9koV-KGC8RUOUJaRDVGUEdDVERDNVozSUw1WEJTSE9ONi4u). You will receive an email once deletion is completed. Then follow the above procedure again to change your sign-in email address.

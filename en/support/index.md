<div class="important-box">To expand our support services , we have introduced a new support desk which is co-operated by student staff ("common supporters") and faculty members.</div>

* The Technical Support Desk aims to respond to inquiries regarding online classes and web conferences.
* Most inquiries will be handled by student staff (i.e. common supporters), but faculty members will take over depending on the nature of the inquiry.
* We offer assistance through chats, Zoom, and email forms. Please contact us through the channel that best suits you. 


## Important Notes on Privacy and Confidentiality of Information 

* To ensure prompt response, initial inquiries are **handled by student staff**. Please keep this in mind and **DO NOT include any confidential information when sending your inquiries.**
* If you have an inquiry where you need to disclose confidential information, such as personal grades, **please use the email form, and click on the “I would like to be supported only by faculty members” checkbox when submitting the form. A faculty member will directly respond.** Please understand that response time will be longer in such cases. 
* If you have any questions or concerns about examinations, **please first contact your instructor or the department/graduate school that offers the examination. If you wish to contact the Technical Support Desk regarding examinations**, please contact us only through the email form. 
* Information obtained from inquiries will be used for replying to and performing tasks related to the inquiry. Information may be shared internally to improve future support service. Information may also be disclosed to the public in individually unidentifiable form for the purpose of introducing UTokyo’s support initiatives through case studies and statistical information, etc.. Information will not be used for any other purposes except for exceptions specified by laws and regulations.
* Student staff have signed confidentiality agreements and handle information under the control and supervision of faculty members. 



## Support via Chat
{:#chat}

A chatbot (an automated response robot) or a human operator will respond to your inquiries made on a chat. The chatbot will initially respond to your inquiry. If necessary, a student operator (also called a “common supporter”) will take over and answer your questions.
* Please note that it may take longer for operators to respond, depending on inquiry volume.   In such cases, please use the email form or try again at a later time. 
* We use MEDiA LiNK. Co.,Ltd. 's sinclo chat service. Connection may sometimes become unstable. If connection does not improve after a certain period of time, please contact us through Zoom or the email form.

* Please note that it may take longer to enter a meeting room, depending on inquiry volume. In such cases, please use the email form or try again at a later time.

Inquiries that include confidential information such as personal grades, will be handled by faculty members. To ensure that such inquiries are directly sent to faculty members (and not opened by student operators), please click on the “I would like to be supported only by faculty members” checkbox in the email form.

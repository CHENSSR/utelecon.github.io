## Important Notes on Privacy and Confidentiality of Information

* If you have an inquiry where you need to disclose confidential information, such as personal grades, **please use the email form, and click on the “I would like to be supported only by faculty members” checkbox when submitting the form. A faculty member will directly respond.** Please understand that response time will be longer in such cases. 
* If you have any questions or concerns about examinations, **please first contact your instructor or the department/graduate school that offers the examination. If you wish to contact the Technical Support Desk regarding examinations**, please contact us only through the email form. 
* Information obtained from inquiries will be used for replying to and performing tasks related to the inquiry. Information may be shared internally to improve future support service. Information may also be disclosed to the public in individually unidentifiable form for the purpose of introducing UTokyo’s support initiatives through case studies and statistical information, etc.. Information will not be used for any other purposes except for exceptions specified by laws and regulations.
* Student staff have signed confidentiality agreements and handle information under the control and supervision of faculty members.

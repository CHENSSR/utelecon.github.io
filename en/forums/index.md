Introduction
---------------------------

We have created the following QA forums and mailing lists:

* [QA Forum](https://groups.google.com/a/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/forum/#!forum/utelecon-questions-group) : Forum for questions, discussions
* [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/forum/#!forum/utelecon-announce-group) : A mailing list for announcements.

(4/24) <font color="red">【Request】</font> How to send inquiries
---------------------------

Currently, we are receiving several inquiries and questions to the utelecon-inquiries (operating portal site) maiing list, and many of the frequently asked question are about zoom and Microsoft Office. We are addressing these questions by making it self-solvable by using a readable forum.

Also, we would like to deliver important announcements directly related to lesson implementation (e.g., issues affecting a large number of people, related to zoom software updates) through utelecon-announce. Thus, we ask for teachers to join the mailing list.

So, again, we ask for ***as many people as possible to join the forum and mailing list mentioned above***.
Also, we ask for school and department heads, and administrative staff to ***inform as many students as possible about this website***.

The following is what we are looking for:

  * utelecon-questions : Serves as a primary channel for issues and technical questions. Directs many of the questions that reach utelecon-inquiries to utelecon-questions. Traffic is large. Sends questions to people by email (can be set by yourself).
 * utelecon-announce : Intended for sharing information and questions related to aspects that largely affect students and other users, like issues related to UTAS, ITC-LMS maintenance information, and Zoom updates.
  * utelecon-inquiries : Mailing list for asking questions that cannot be widely shared.

**Method 3:** The following is an explanation for those who are already familiar with Google Groups. If someone is already a member (let's say Mr./Ms. H) and the registered address is a Google account or its alias, that person can be added to the group.  Mr./Ms. H can visit the group’s homepage to edit.  If you are registering a large number of people, using this method will help disperse the number of registrations that would otherwise be necessary.

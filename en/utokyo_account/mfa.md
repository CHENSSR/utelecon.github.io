## Introduction

In order to improve the security of UTokyo's IT systems, multi-factor authentication will be available for UTokyo Accounts starting September 27, 2021.

This page provides information about multi-factor authentication for UTokyo Accounts. Please check this page for any updates.

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process in which users prove their identity by at least two pieces of evidence. In addition to passwords, users are asked to verify their identity via SMS, authentication applications, and other methods when signing in to their accounts.

MFA assures the userâ€™s identity at a higher level and improves the account security. This reduces the risk of unauthorized sign-ins even if your password has been compromised.

## Implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts

MFA will be available for all UTokyo Accounts after the MFA launch date. Users can then set up MFA for their accounts following the procedure in the next section. Once MFA is enabled, users will be required to verify their identity via SMS or an authentication application every time they sign in to their UTokyo Accounts.

It is recommended to have MFA set up for better security of your UTokyo Account. However, MFA setup is not mandatory at this time, and you can continue to use your UTokyo Account without MFA. The only exception is users of the new UTokyo VPN for faculty members. The new UTokyo VPN will require MFA, so faculty members who wish to use the system will need to set up MFA. (For more information about UTokyo VPN, please refer to the [UTokyo Portal page (for faculty members only)](https://univtokyo.sharepoint.com/sites/utokyoportal/wiki/d/UTokyo_VPN.aspx).)


## Setup Procedures
Details on how to set up MFA will be posted on this page in due course.

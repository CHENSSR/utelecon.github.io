　An online course on  "How to use Zoom with online class in mind" was conducted on March 19, 2020, from 15:00 to 17:00. 
  
  
　Specifically, we first described the main forms of online classes, and the basic flow of a simple online lesson using Zoom (how to create a room, how to enter and exit, etc.). After that, as a practical part, microphone and camera settings, participant management (mute control), screen sharing (material presentation), chat (question and answer), raising hand (question and answer), voting (question from teacher) , Breakout (group work) and other functions were introduced.  
  
  
　we are sorry for those who could not participate because the meeting exceeded 1000 people immediately after the start. We will release a video of the course at a later date, so we hope you can watch it.  
　Also, thank you for those who participated on the day. Even after the basic course, individual consultation time was set up, and 500 people remained for about 30 minutes from the start, and 200 people remained for about 1 hour and 30 minutes from the start. Thank you for your participation.

## Operation system on the day
　The operation on the day was coordinated by two instructors: one instructor explained along the slide, and the other instructor constantly checked the chat, sharing important questions and comments as needed. took. In addition, Dr. Taura, Director of the Information Technology Center, responded to questions that came up by chat.   
    
## What we have learning from the online course with 1000 participants
　Following the flow of the presentation materials, people were able to get to know about various functions while actually experiencing Zoom.
In addition, because it is difficult for participants to work together only with Zoom, we implemented Google Spreadsheets, so participants could share information on copyright-free materials and their own experience using Zoom in lessons. 

* What worked well
  * It proceeded without audio and video troubles (some participants commented that the audio could not be heard, but it was due to the device settings on the participant side) 
  * We were able to use the chat without any problems (the chat screen became a little heavier in the second half).
  * The hand-raising function also worked well.  
  * The poll function (function for asking multiple-choice questions from the organizer to the participants) was used without any problems by the organizer. However, it seems that some participants could not answer the poll.
  * Recording was also fine (2 hours 30 minutes mp4 file, size 376MB, was generated). 
<br>
* What did not work
  * Google Sheets did not work.
    * Some tools might be unavailable due to heavy traffic in the file.
	* We are currently analyzing the access log to find out what is the limit of people able to access and edit the file at the same time (as of March 19, 2020, it seems difficult for 1000 people to collaborate on spreadsheets).
  * Breakout session did not work
    * Pressing "Start All Sessions" after assigning sessions resulted in no response from the system.
    * After the basic course, we had been doing individual consultations, and the breakout room function worked well in classes with 200 participants.

## Questionnaire results
　120 participants answered the questionnaire.  
　80% percent of the participants were faculty members, and more than 90% of the respondents answered that the online course was useful.  
　Although there is room for improvement, the instructors were relieved with the feedback.

## eduroam

eduroam is a wireless LAN service that can be used mutually among universities and research institutes. Members of the University of Tokyo can use eduroam at other universities and research institutes with the same user ID and password as their UTokyo Wi-Fi account <small>(limited to UTokyo Wi-Fi accounts issued after January 31, 2023)</small>.

\* The former "EDUROAM for u-tokyo.ac.jp members site" will stop issuing new accounts on March 31, 2023, and accounts will no longer be available on and after May 1, 2023. Please use your UTokyo Wi-Fi account to use eduroam.

- Please refer to the [eduroam JP Privacy Policy](https://meatwiki.nii.ac.jp/confluence/x/WYX0BQ) when using eduroam.
- You can also use eduroam on the University of Tokyo campus, but your connection will be treated as an off-campus network, and you will not be able to use databases, e-journals, e-books, etc. The eduroam service on the University of Tokyo campus is provided for external users, so members should basically use the UTokyo Wi-Fi service on campus.

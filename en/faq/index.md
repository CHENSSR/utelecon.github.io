ITC-LMS
==============

ECCS Online Course
==============

Attended the online class and took the exam, but "Pass" sign does not appear. Even if I try to take the class again, the "ECCS new user class" is not displayed at the bottom left of the timetable.
--------------

* Some people reported facing this issue. If you do not see the "ECCS New User Workshop", you have actually passed. If you are still concerned, please contact us.

“Take an exam” button does not appear after I finish watching online courses
--------------

* The "take an exam" button will appear on the original tab where the ITC-LMS screen is displayed in the browser when you finish watching the video. Please note that it may be a different tab from the video. Please see the tab where the ITC-LMS is displayed.

Cannot sign to Microsoft Office. 
The message "We could not find an account with that Username. Enter a different username, or issue a new Microsoft account" is displayed when entering a username on the “Sign in” page.
--------------

* The user name you entered may be incorrect. Please enter "Common ID@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp" here. The common ID is a 10-digit number.
* Did you make an application request? If you haven't done so already, log in to the <a href="https://utacm.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/webmtn/LoginServlet" target="_blank">UTokyo Account User Menu</a>, select "Office 365 ProPlus Application Request" from the menu on the left. Enter yes to accept the terms of the license agreement and select "Save."
* It will take some time from the application to be able to use the service. Please wait for up to 3 hours during the day, or until 11:00 the next morning at night (To be exact, applications are proceeded at 11:00, 14:00, 17:00, and 20:00 every day. Wait until the most recent one after you select “Save.”)
* If it still does not work, this procedure may help. Select "No" to accept the terms of the license agreement, and "Save." Then, select "Yes" this time and “Save.” (and wait for the above time.)

Icons of apps such as Excel and Word do not appear on <a href="https://www.office.com/?auth=2" target="_blank"> Office sign in screen</a>
--------------

Q. **What is ITC-LMS?**  
A. It is a learning management system of our university. Students can view the materials distributed by the faculty members regarding the classes they are taking / have taken, submit the assignments, discuss and ask questions on the bulletin board (if the faculty members have created them), answer questionnaires, and take exams.  
Reference: <a href="https://www.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/itc-lms/faq.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a>,  <a href="https://www.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/itc-lms/index.html" target="_blank">About ITC-LMS</a>.

  

Q. **What is ECCS Cloud Email?**  
A. This is a Google email of our university. Since this account is a Google account, you can also use some Google services such as Google Drive (file storage), Google Docs (similar to Word), Google spreadsheets (similar to Excel), Google forms (web surveys), and YouTube etc. 
Reference: <a href="https://www.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/announcement/2017/04/26_2495.html" target="_blank">Users guide</a>，<a href="http://www.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/DigitalLife/perFile/12_ec_gakusei-cloud.pdf" target="_blank">Utilization of ECCS cloud mail</a>  
  
  
Q. **How should I take attendance?**  
A. There are the following methods.
  * Use ITC-LMS<a href="https://www.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/announcement/2014/05/13_1904.html" target="_blank"> Attendance Management</a>.
  * Use web surveys such as Google Forms and Microsoft Forms
    * (Counter-measures against students answering for someone else) Make it mandatory to answer questions about the content of the lesson and write their impressions of the course.
    * (Counter-measures against students answering for someone else) When creating a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/?tgif=d" target="_blank">Google form </a>using an ECCS cloud mail account (our university's Google account), turn on “Collect email addresses” and “Restrict to users in UTokyo ECCS Cloud Mail and its trusted organizations” from the “Settings (gear mark)” on the form edit screen. (This function requires students to answer the form using their own ECCS cloud email, which lowers the risk of answering for someone else).
  * If you do not have too many students in a class, you can keep an attendance poll (In this case, you can also ask the students to turn on the video and check their faces directly).

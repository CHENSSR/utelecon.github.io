<a name="should_i_activate"> </a>

Do I need to create (activate) a Zoom account?
-----------------

* The "Meeting Host" requires an account. That is, a person who sets up a meeting to teach, typically a teacher, or a TA acting on its behalf.
* Someone using the Zoom feature to attend a conference that is “limited to users who are authenticated by g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp” needs an account. Some classes require this in order to control who takes part in online classes, so make an account if you want to attend those lectures.
* Otherwise, creating an account is not necessary.


<a name="how_to_get_invitation"> </a>

I heard that an "email for account activation invitation" has been sent. What should I do?
-----------------

* The invitation is sent to your ECCS Cloud Mail ( abcde123@ g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp). “abcde123'' is the string of characters that you set in the initial setting of ECCS Cloud Mail.
* <a href="https://hwb.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wp/literacy/email/initialize/" target="_blank">Set up an email account </a> if you have never used ECCS cloud mail.
* After that, log in from  <a href="https://gmail.com" target="_blank">Gmail</a> with the above account. If you already have another Gmail account, please log out of that one first.
* You can also<a href="https://mail.google.com/a/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp" target="_blank"> log in from here</a>.

<a name="I_dont_find_invitation"> </a>

I have checked my ECCS cloud email (abcde123@ g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp), but I cannot find the "Account activation invite email"
-----------------

* Check if it is in the spam mail folder.
* The email was sent to faculty and staff on March 16th, and to students on March 24th to 25th. Emails may not have been sent to those who did not have a UTokyo Account at that time.
* UTokyo Account should be assigned to new students from April 2020 at that time, but it may be different depending on your affiliation.

<a name="still_basic"> </a>

User Type is “Basic” instead of “Licensed”
-----------------

* Make sure you are signed in to Zoom with the “10 digit common ID@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp.”
  * Visit [Zoom HomePage](https://zoom.us/) 
  *  Check your profile on MY ACCOUNT and confirm that the Sign-In Email is the “10-digit common ID @ g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp”
  * In that case, User Type should be displayed as Licensed and Capacity should be displayed as "Meeting 500, Webinar 500".
  * It may say **Free Trial**on the "Account Profile" screen, but this is not a problem.

<!-- * **** そうなっていなかったら **** (例えばZoomに登録していない状態で10桁@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp でサインアップしちゃったら?) -->
* If are you signed in with another account, sign out and sign in again with your “10-digit common ID @ g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp.”
* If you cannot sign in with the “10-digit common ID @ g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp”, you may be able to activate it using the procedures described <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=T6978HAr10eaAgh1yvlMhI_ifmf7qdFDpTYBBcm0ltJUOUxJQ1VWMjhDSTZKTUU1Wk1LVEUyNTlLUS4u" target="_blank">  here</a>.

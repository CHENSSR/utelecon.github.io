1. Check if the account name on the [Zoom  account Profile Page](https://zoom.us/account) is displayed as "UTokyo Zoom". If so, the account creation process was successful.

  * Immediately after creation , even if the user type is Basic on the profile page（[https://zoom.us/profile](https://zoom.us/profile)）, it will be changed to Licensed within an hour, so please wait for a while. 
  * Even when your account is changed to "Licensed", it will say "Free trial" on the account profile page（[https://zoom.us/account](https://zoom.us/account)).

### I'm having trouble signing up for Zoom
* Please confirm if you have not already created an account with a 10 digit common ID @g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp
  * Please try signing in with the common ID 10 digit @g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp address on the[Zoom sign-in page](https://zoom.us/signin)(if you are already signed in with another account, please sign out).
  * If you do not know the password, enter the 10-digit common ID @g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp address on the [password reset page](https://zoom.us/forgot_password), and use the email from Zoom that came to ECCS Cloud Email to enter the password. Reset your passsword.

### User type is now Basic instead of Licensed
* If you have a Zoom account with a common ID of 10 digits @g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp, it will be licensed within an hour, so please wait a moment.


## In case it still does not work

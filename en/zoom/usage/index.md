In this section we give concrete directions on how to use Zoom.  


The following screen is displayed when entering a meeting room（this screenshot shows a meeting room with only 1 participant）.
If you move the mouse cursor over the Zoom screen, the menu bar shown in the figure below will pop up.  
  ![](main_numbering.png)  
The menu buttons are explained from left to right （some version may not display all the buttons as here）．
  1. **Microphone mark** : Press this to mute (mute) or unmute (the screen shows "mute off" because it is currently muted). Pressing the arrow mark next to it enables you to make settings related to the microphone.
  1. **Video mark** : Press to turn the video on or off (the screen shows "Start Video" because the camera is currently off). Pressing the up mark next to it will allow you to make video settings.
  1. **Invitation** : You can send an invitation by e-mail. Since the organizer and participants already know the URL of the conference room, they can invite others by sharing the meeting URL.
  1. **Screen Share** : You can share screens in your device.
  1. **Reactions** : You can express reactions by sending "applause" or "agree" emoji.
  1. **Details** : Menus that could not fit on the screen are included here (If the screen width is large enough, all menus will be displayed on the screen and "Details" may not be displayed).
      **Participants** : Displays a list of participants.  
	  **Chat** : text chat.  
	  **Record on this computer** : You can record if your host allows it. This button is often not used by anyone other than the organizer.  
  1. **Leave meeting** : Leave the meeting. A confirmation screen appears after you press it, so you do not exit immediately when you press the button.
  
  
The following describes the details of the menu items mostly used.

  * If you select "Whiteboard", a whiteboard in which you can draw freely will be shared with everyone.
  * Selecting "iPhone / iPad" will allow you to share your iPhone / iPad screen (plug-in required). You can share via AirPlay from devices in the same WiFi network.
  * The currently open window is also displayed as an option. You can also share the screen in window units. If you don't want others to see all of your computer windows, we recommend that you select the window unity you want to share.

In this section, we introduce how teachers can use Zoom in classroom through interactive videos.   
We hope that you understand that there are some differences from general web conference usage when compared to specialized in classes.  
Also, since we aim to make as many videos as possible, we hope that you understand that the editing is simple. 

<a name="schedule"> </a>
## Creating a recurrent meeting for a 13 classes courses, and using a single URL
By scheduling regular meetings, you can create a conference room with a common URL to be used over the semester.  
However, it is important to note that you can set up a recurring meeting **only from a Web browser**.  
First, sign in to your <a href="https://zoom.us/profile" target="_blank">Zoom My Page</a> with your account and press "Schedule a Meeting" in the upper right corner.
Check the box "Regular Meeting" in the settings, so you can schedule a regular meeting using the same URL.
Please refer to the following video (in Japanese) for details on how to use this function.

<a name="sharing_screen_materials"> </a>
## Presenting PowerPoint and Word materials（Screen sharing）
During class, students can see the screen the teacher is looking at by pressing the Zoom menu "Share screen" → "Screen" → "Share".  
Like that, you can continue your lecture while showing Powerpoint presentations or Word files.
When you finish sharing the screen, press "Stop Sharing" at the top or bottom of the screen. 
  * With the method described above, the entire screen is displayed, so you may unintentionally share your personal information. Instead, it is possible to share not the entire screen but only the window of interest. Like that, you do not need to worry about opening personal information to participants.
  * 
While sharing the screen, the menu is hidden at the top or bottom of the screen. Hover the mouse icon over the meeting ID displayed to the left of “Stop sharing” to display other menu such as “Manage participants”. 
  * 
During screen sharing, the screen of the student's PC is set as full screen and cannot be moved to another window. Here, if the student double-clicks on the Zoom screen, it will not be displayed in full screen, and it will be easier to move to another window.If you want your students to use a window other than Zoom, such as a web browser, while the teacher is sharing the screen, we recommend you to instruct participants to double-click the Zoom screen.

## Questions via Chat（Chat）

You can text chat with everyone by pressing the "Chat" menu during the class. This feature allows students to ask questions using chat. You can check the chat and answer questions from students during classes as necessary.

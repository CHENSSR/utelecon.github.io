## Introduction

Congratulations everyone, welcome to your new school.

In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, our university has introduced online classes since the 2020 academic year. In this 2021 academic year, we will begin hybrid educational activities and incorporate face-to-face classes as much as possible after taking sufficient infection prevention measures.

We received positive feedback from students last year in a survey regarding their online learning experiences, owing to the effort spare on lesson delivery and other considerations. It is reported that certain features and educational effects, in which face-to-face instruction lacks, are realized in online classes. We will continue to strive for excellence in online teaching in the academic year 2021/22.

In this portal, we have made appropriate preparations to realize better online classes and to utilize our past experiences to achieve higher educational effect, making full use of the  feedback, requests and ideas from students and faculty members of the University of Tokyo. We hope that this page will help you to start your university activities smoothly.

We, the faculty and staff of the University of Tokyo, would like to live up to your wishes so that you can enjoy face-to-face classes and campus activities without any anxiety, while protecting your health and prioritising secured academic opportunities. We will engage to ensure that you can effectively complete your study and have a fulfilling student life.

## What type of online classes will be held at the University of Tokyo?

There are various types of online classes, but the "**simultaneous interactive**" type is mainly adopted at the University of Tokyo for which real time teacher-student interaction is performed with a web conference system application through audio and video exchanges. You can use this system to connect with dozens or hundreds of people in a class. The necessary preparations for using the system are explained in this page.

Apart from the aforementioned type of online classes, there is the "**on-demand**" type which students watch video recordings of classes, ask questions and discuss the contents via e-mail or chat tools. The "**hybrid**" type combines online classes with face-to-face instruction. It is noted that classes at the University of Tokyo are not online-only, some face-to-face instruction also remains. Owing to that students might have to take online classes in empty classrooms on campus before or after their face-to-face classes, depending on their timetable constraints.

## What you need to prepare

### Use of a range of information systems

You will be using a variety of information systems in your classes at the University of Tokyo. You should set up your account and practice the procedures for using these systems in advance. Below is a general view of the systems, and detailed procedures will be explained in subsequent sections.

### Network environment and electronic devices

In order to take online classes, you will need an Internet environment and equipment such as a computer. Here is an explanation of what you need to prepare.

- **Network environment**: No problem as long as you can view videos stably, but pay attention to the communication capacity for long online classes. In particular, if you are using a smartphone directly connected to a mobile network (LTE, etc.), please make sure that you do not run out of gigs.
    - The university surely provides Wi-Fi on campus.
    - The University of Tokyo provides support for those who do not have an adequate network environment. For more details, please check "[The network environment support for education and research](/mobile/)" page.
- **PC**: If you just want to watch online classes, a smartphone will work for you. However, in university, you will often need a computer for many purposes such as writing reports. In online classes, you also need to do some work or exercises while watching the videos. If you do not have a computer, this is a good opportunity to get one.
    - A portable laptop is recommended so that you can use it on campus.
    - If you are buying a new computer, we recommend one with a microphone and camera. If you are going to use a computer you already own, there is no need to worry if it does not have a microphone or camera. Most classes are designed to accommodate those who do not have them, and for some classes such as language classes, it may be desirable to have them, but you can also buy an external one.
    - In consideration of the above points, models and versions do not matter unless it is not too old. As long as you can view videos, it should be fine.
    <!-- - （学部1年生向け）教養学部が作成している「[オンライン授業に必要な機器や通学前の準備について](https://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/zenki/OnlineClasses_preparation20210317.pdf)」に具体的なスペックの目安が記載されています．-->
    - You may also refer to the Co-op's special topic page about computers for new students, "[Komaba Model PC for Examinees and New Students Support Site 2021 (Japanese Only)](https://www.utcoop.or.jp/start/pc.html)".
    - If you do not have a sufficient computer environment, please consult with your faculty or graduate school. (For example, the College of Liberal Arts [lends out computers](https://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/campuslife/online-lectures.html))
- **Headset or earphones**: When taking online classes in an empty classroom on campus, you will need a headset or earphones in order to listen to the audio without disturbing other students in the same classroom. A headset with a microphone is recommended when purchasing a new one.

### Information on class URL

This section is coming soon.

### Others

- Some information about classes is provided by your faculty or graduate school, such as timetables and class registration procedures. Please be aware of how you will be informed of this information and check it regularly (if you are uncertain, contact your faculty or graduate school).
- In order to enter the campus, you need to take the [COVID-19 e-learning](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/general/COVID-19-elearning.html) course and [apply for admission](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/covid-19/en/safety/entry-restrictions.html) in advance. Please note that some of these services cannot be used without respective accounts. For this purpose, make sure you have access to the university's systems properly.

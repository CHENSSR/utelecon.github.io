## Introduction

Congratulations everyone, welcome to your new school.

In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, our university has introduced online classes since the 2020 academic year. In this 2021 academic year, we will begin hybrid educational activities and incorporate face-to-face classes as much as possible after taking sufficient infection prevention measures.

We received positive feedback from students last year in a survey regarding their online learning experiences, owing to the effort spare on lesson delivery and other considerations. It is reported that certain features and educational effects, in which face-to-face instruction lacks, are realized in online classes. We will continue to strive for excellence in online teaching in the academic year 2021/22.

In this portal, we have made appropriate preparations to realize better online classes and to utilize our past experiences to achieve higher educational effect, making full use of the  feedback, requests and ideas from students and faculty members of the University of Tokyo. We hope that this page will help you to start your university activities smoothly.

We, the faculty and staff of the University of Tokyo, would like to live up to your wishes so that you can enjoy face-to-face classes and campus activities without any anxiety, while protecting your health and prioritising secured academic opportunities. We will engage to ensure that you can effectively complete your study and have a fulfilling student life.

## What type of online classes will be held at the University of Tokyo?

There are various types of online classes, but the "**simultaneous interactive**" type is mainly adopted at the University of Tokyo for which real time teacher-student interaction is performed with a web conference system application through audio and video exchanges. You can use this system to connect with dozens or hundreds of people in a class. The necessary preparations for using the system are explained in this page.

Apart from the aforementioned type of online classes, there is the "**on-demand**" type which students watch video recordings of classes, ask questions and discuss the contents via e-mail or chat tools. The "**hybrid**" type combines online classes with face-to-face instruction. It is noted that classes at the University of Tokyo are not online-only, some face-to-face instruction also remains. Owing to that students might have to take online classes in empty classrooms on campus before or after their face-to-face classes, depending on their timetable constraints.

## What You Need to Prepare for Classes

### Use of Various Information Systems

You will be using a variety of information systems during your classes at UTokyo. You should set up an account and practice all procedures for using these systems in advance. Below is a list of these systems. The detailed procedures are explained in the subsequent sections:

{% capture about_utokyo_account %}This is the account you will use to log into UTokyo’s ICT systems. The username may also be referred to as “Common ID”.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_utas %}This system is used to browse the syllabus for each class, register courses, and check the grades (academic affairs system).{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_itc_lms %}This system is used to download class material and submit assignments (learning management system).{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_google %}This is a UTokyo Google account that allows users to use Google services, such as Gmail, as a UTokyo member. The ECCS Cloud Email can also be used as a UTokyo email address. Since some UTokyo web pages can only be accessed by UTokyo members, you are required to activate your ECCS Cloud Email even if you already own a Google account.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_microsoft %}This is a Microsoft license offered to UTokyo Account holders. This license will enable you to download Microsoft Office apps, such as Word and Excel, and use online Microsoft tools for free with the UTokyo Account. Similar to Google Workspace, some UTokyo webpages can only be accessed with a UTokyo Account. Therefore, it is necessary to use your UTokyo Account even if you already own a Microsoft account.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_utokyo_wifi %}Wi-Fi services are available on campus. You will require them while taking online classes on campus. Please note that you will not be able to use Wi-Fi services unless you have created an account in advance.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_eccs %}ECCS terminals refer to the computers installed on campus. You can use them while taking online classes on campus. You also use them in some face-to-face classes. Please note that you will not be able to use them unless you have passed the “New User Information Seminar” course in advance.{% endcapture %}

### Network Environment and Electronic Devices

To take online classes, you will need an Internet connection and equipment such as a computer. The following is an explanation of how you will need to prepare.

- **Network connection**: There should be no problem with slower connections as long as you can watch videos stably. However, pay attention to the communication capacity when taking long online classes. More specifically, if you are using a smartphone directly connected to a mobile network (e.g., LTE), please ensure that you do not run out of data.
    - The university provides Wi-Fi on campus.
    - The University of Tokyo provides support for new students who do not have adequate network connections. For more details, please check “[The network environment support for education and research](/mobile/)”.
- **PC**: A smartphone should be sufficient if you just want to watch online classes. However, in university, you will often need a computer for many purposes, such as writing reports. In online classes, you will also need to do some work or exercises while watching videos.
    - A portable laptop is recommended so that you can use it on campus.
    - For specifications, please refer to “[東京大学のBYOD方針](/docs/byod) (The University of Tokyo's BYOD Policy)” (in Japanese).
    <!-- - (For first-year undergraduate students) The College of Arts and Sciences provides guidelines for required PC specifications in “オンライン授業に必要な機器や通学前の準備について(Devices necessary for online classes and preparation for attending college)” (in Japanese). -->
    - You may also refer to the Co-op’s special topic page about computers for new students, “[受験生・新入生応援サイト2022 駒場モデルパソコン](https://text.univ.coop/puk/START/utcoop/pc.html) (Komaba Model PC for Examinees and New Students Support Site)” (in Japanese).
    - If you do not have a computer that meets the above mentioned requirements, please consult with your faculty or graduate school. (For example, the College of Arts and Sciences can [lend out computers](https://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/campuslife/online-lectures.html) (in Japanese).)
- **Headset and earphones**: When taking online classes in an empty classroom on campus, you will need a headset or earphones to listen to the class without disturbing other students in the same classroom. A headset equipped with a microphone is recommended when purchasing one.

### Class Location Information

To participate in a “simultaneous interactive” online class, you will need to know the URL of the web conference. This information is normally posted in the “Online course information” section of the ITC-LMS introduced above. However, depending on the class, the lecturer may inform you of the URL through other means. Please refer to the “[How to Obtain the Online Class URL (for Students)](url)” regarding other ways of obtaining the URL.

## When You Need help

If you have any problems, difficulties, or concerns regarding online classes, please consult the **[Technical Support Desk](/en/support/)**. Common Supporters (student staff) and faculty members will assist you in solving any problem you may have.

For example, the following questions and consultations are welcome.

- “I followed the preparation procedures described on this guide, but they did not work.”
- “I have a last-minute problem when trying to participate in an online class.”
- “I am unable to download class materials.”

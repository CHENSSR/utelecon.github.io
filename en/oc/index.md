## Greetings
To all new students, congratulations on your enrollment in the University of Tokyo.

The University of Tokyo will mainly conduct face-to-face classes in the academic year 2023, after taking necessary measures to prevent infection. On the other hand, we will also offer online classes and hybrid classes that combine face-to-face and online classes when it is possible to enhance the educational effect. In addition, the use of digital technology is progressing even in face-to-face classes, and there are many situations in which information systems are used, such as distribution of teaching materials and submission of assignments. We would like to ask you to prepare the necessary information systems so that you can participate in the class smoothly. Please prepare a laptop computer that you can take with you and set up your account and various tools. The university is also continuing to improve the environment by updating and enhancing Wi-Fi throughout the university over the two years (FY2022 and FY2023), making it available in most parts of campus so that you can enjoy your activities on campus.

The University of Tokyo is also making progress with digital transformation (DX) initiatives. Digital technologies such as chat tools and web conferencing have greatly changed the form of communication, making it easier for people to interact and collaborate with each other at a different location. However, there are still unknowns about how to incorporate new technologies into university activities. We would like to take on the challenge of creating the next generation of education together with students, and we hope that you will actively participate.

This portal site, "utelecon,"  brings together information on the University of Tokyo system. First, please check the necessary preparations for taking classes. We also introduce advanced methods of using various tools, so we hope that you will make use of this site not only for classes, but also for your own activities such as study groups and circle activities. If you have any problems or difficulties, please feel free to ask questions at the support desk.

Our faculty and staff are committed to meeting your wishes so that you can enjoy face-to-face classes and other activities on campus without any worries, while placing the highest priority on protecting your health and ensuring your study opportunities. We will do our best to ensure that your studies are effective and your student life is fulfilling.

## Class Format at the University of Tokyo
At the University of Tokyo, classes are offered in a wide range of formats, including face-to-face and online. Face-to-face classes are conventional classes held in classrooms, and online classes are classes in which students can participate without being in the classroom using web conferencing systems for example. Please check with the faculty, the graduate school or the instructor in charge of the class to find out in which format the class will be held.

### Online Classes
There are various types of online classes, but the main type of online class at the University of Tokyo is the "**simultaneous interactive**" type. This is a form of real-time interactive communication between the teacher and students using applications such as Zoom and Webex, a type of web conferencing system that allows audio and video exchange. The necessary preparations for using the system are explained in this page.

Other forms include the "**on-demand**" type, in which students watch video recordings of classes and ask questions and discuss them via email or chat tools, and the "**hybrid**" type , in which online classes are combined with face-to-face classes in the classroom. 

## What You Need to Prepare for Classes

### Use of Various Information Systems

You will be using a variety of information systems during your classes at UTokyo. You should set up an account and practice all procedures for using these systems in advance. Below is a list of these systems. The detailed procedures are explained in the subsequent sections:

### Network Environment and Electronic Devices

To take classes, you will need an Internet connection and equipment such as a computer. The following is an explanation of how you will need to prepare.

- **Network connection**: There should be no problem with slower connections as long as you can watch videos stably. However, pay attention to the communication capacity when taking long online classes. More specifically, if you are using a smartphone directly connected to a mobile network (e.g., LTE), please ensure that you do not run out of data.
    - The university provides Wi-Fi on campus.
<!--    - The University of Tokyo provides support for new students who do not have adequate network connections. For more details, please check “[The network environment support for education and research](/mobile/)”. -->
- **PC**: You will often need a computer for writing reports, and also when you do some work or exercises while watching videos.
    - A portable laptop is recommended so that you can use it on campus.
    - For specifications, please refer to “[東京大学のBYOD方針](/docs/byod) (The University of Tokyo's BYOD Policy)” (in Japanese).
    <!-- - (For first-year undergraduate students) The College of Arts and Sciences provides guidelines for required PC specifications in “オンライン授業に必要な機器や通学前の準備について(Devices necessary for online classes and preparation for attending college)” (in Japanese). -->
    - You may also refer to the Co-op’s special topic page about computers for new students, “[受験生・新入生応援サイト2022 駒場モデルパソコン](https://text.univ.coop/puk/START/utcoop/pc.html) (Komaba Model PC for Examinees and New Students Support Site)” (in Japanese).
    - If you do not have a computer that meets the above mentioned requirements, please consult with your faculty or graduate school. (For example, the College of Arts and Sciences can [lend out computers](https://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/campuslife/online-lectures.html) (in Japanese).)
- **Headset and earphones**: When taking online classes in an empty classroom on campus, you will need a headset or earphones to listen to the class without disturbing other students in the same classroom. A headset equipped with a microphone is recommended when purchasing one.

## When You Need help

If you have any problems, difficulties, or concerns regarding online classes, please consult the **[Technical Support Desk](/en/support/)**. Common Supporters (student staff) and faculty members will assist you in solving any problem you may have.

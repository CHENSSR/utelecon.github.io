### Security measure

UTokyo's network, including UTokyo WiFi, is secured by a university-wide security firewall and other measures to ensure information security.
<!--    - 全学セキュリティファイアウォールについては[ファイアウォールによる通信の遮断等についてのページ（学内のみ）](http://ngfw.cert.u-tokyo.ac.jp/firewall.html)を参照してください．-->
- Some websites cannot be viewed over UTokyo WiFi because they are blocked by the university-wide security firewall.
- [UTokyo-CERT](https://cert.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html) may contact the user by e-mail if a communication is detected that may cause a security problem.
    - Their e-mail addresses are `utokyo-wifi-cert.adm_at_gs.mail.u-tokyo.ac.jp` or `utokyo-wifi-tf_at_itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp` （please read `_at_` as @)．
    - Failure to respond to communications may result in account suspension. In order to reinstate a suspended account, you must consult with your department's CERT and take reasonable steps to prevent recurrence.

## Others

- There is no limit to the number of devices that can be connected per UTokyo WiFi account.
- UYou cannot delete your UTokyo WiFi account directly. However, you can re-issue a new account by clicking the "New Application" button in the "UTokyo WiFi Account Menu", and your existing account will become invalid.
- If you are in charge of a departmental network, please also refer to [Information on UTokyo Portal](https://univtokyo.sharepoint.com/sites/utokyoportal/wiki/d/UTokyo_WiFi_Management.aspx). 

## Troubleshooting and Inquiries

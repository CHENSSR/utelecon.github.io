## Introduction

To all new faculty members of the University of Tokyo,

In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, our university has introduced online classes since the 2020 academic year. In this 2021 academic year, we will begin hybrid educational activities and incorporate face-to-face classes as much as possible after taking sufficient infection prevention measures.

We received positive feedback from students last year in a survey regarding their online learning experiences, owing to the effort spared on lesson delivery and other considerations. It is reported that certain features and educational effects, in which face-to-face instruction lacks, are realized in online classes. We will continue to strive for excellence in online teaching in the academic year 2021/22. 

In this portal, we have made appropriate preparations to realize better online classes and to utilize our past experiences to achieve higher educational effect, making full use of the  feedback, requests and ideas from students and faculty members of the University of Tokyo. 

Regarding online classes, we have selected the Good Practices for 2020 and are sharing them among faculty members on this site. Please refer to this site for information on how to create effective online classes. We hope that you will find the information useful and meaningful to your educational activities. To help students achieve their academic goals and live a fulfilling life through teaching and learning activities, your understanding and cooperation is mostly appreciated.

## Three main types of online classes

In this section, we will introduce the three main types of online classes, compare them with traditional classes, explore their respective characteristics, and explain the requirements for online classes (media classes).

![Conventional class and main types of online classes](img/types_overview.png)

While conventional classes are conducted face-to-face in real time, online classes can be categorized into three main types: face-to-face and online in real time (synchronous hybrid type), online only in real time (synchronous online type), and online learning at the student's own pace (on-demand type) (asynchronous online type).

For online classes in our university, about 80% are synchronous online, which makes itself the major type. The characteristics of the captioned three types vary from one to another, and below is an explanation of each.

### Real-time (online) type (synchronous online type)

* This is a type of class in which all students and faculty members are connected online using a web conference system.
* About 80% of our university's classes are of this type.
* The requirements for this type of online class (media class) are "simultaneous and interactive", which can be met by using a web conference system for chatting and voice communication, or by using a video distribution system with a function to accept comments. If you use a web conferencing system, you can meet this requirement because it allows chat and voice communication.

  * [Online Class Information Exchange Meeting (in Japanese)](/events/2020-luncheon/)
    * 19\. Good Practice Case Study (1) Interaction in large group online classes
    * 20\. Good Practice Case Study (2) Class design based on students' voices
    * 21\. Good Practice Case Study (3) How to activate interaction in a live class
    * 24\. Good Practice Case Study (4) Creating a space for questions by utilizing TA
    * 25\. Good Practice Case Study (5) Using various tools to activate and facilitate classes
    * 26\. Good Practice Case (6) Implementing online classes for large groups and devising tests
    * 29\. Good Practice Case (9) Making practical classes online
    * 30\. Practical examples of classes conducted in a VR (virtual 　reality) classroom

### Real-time (face-to-face + online) type (synchronous hybrid type)

* For this type, the class is held in an actual classroom and the content is delivered via a web conference system. 
* This type can meet the needs of students who want to learn face-to-face.<!--

* The requirements for this type of online classes (media class) are "simultaneous and interactive" which can be met by using a web conference system for chatting and voice, communication, or by using a function that can accept comments even if the class is video-delivered. If you use a web conferencing system, you can meet this requirement because you can chat and make voice calls.

    * 16\. Hybrid class (1) Organizing concepts and practical examples in seminars
    * 17\. Hybrid class (2) Practical examples in a large class
    * 18\. Hybrid class (3) Practical examples of classes that promote dialogue between remote and face-to-face students

### Demand type (asynchronous online type)

* This is a form of learning in which students study individually based on materials prepared by instructors using a learning management system. For example, the following methods are possible:
  * Students watch video materials prepared by the instructor or existing video materials such as OCW (Open Course Ware) and MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) within a set range every week, submit assignments and answer questions on the bulletin board separately.
  * Using a web conference system, students watch recordings of classes conducted in real time, submit assignments, and answer questions on the bulletin board.
* The following two are requirements for this type of online class (media class). For example, the teacher can provide a web bulletin board (ITC-LMS has this function) to encourage students to exchange opinions, design quizzes, ask questions, and answer questions about the class content.
    1. Either of the following two methods should be used, together with sufficient instruction through answering questions, corrective guidance, question-and-answer sessions, etc.
        1. In each class, the teaching assistant must meet the students in a place other than the classroom.
        1. In conducting each class, the teacher in charge or the teaching assistant shall switch to the Internet or other appropriate methods promptly after the class ends.
    1. Opportunities for students to exchange opinions on the class must be secured (this can be achieved with the bulletin board function of the learning management system ITC-LMS).

### List of information systems

The following is a list of information systems operated and contracted by the University of Tokyo that are necessary for online classes, including learning management systems (systems for distributing class materials and collecting assignments), web conference systems, and cloud services. These systems have functions suitable for classroom use, such as the ability to hold meetings and share files only with University of Tokyo accounts, and students are accustomed to using these systems, so we recommend that you use these systems for your classes. The procedures for preparing an account are explained in detail in this document.

{% capture about_utokyo_account %}This is an account called "common ID" used in the University of Tokyo's information systems. You will use this account to log in to each system.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_utas %}This is the system used to register syllabi, grades, etc.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_itc_lms %}This is a system for distributing class materials and collecting assignments (learning management system), similar to UTAS, but UTAS is mainly used before (syllabus registration) and after (grade registration) classes start, while ITC-LMS is mainly used during classes.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_google %}This is a Google system (G Suite for Education) that can be used with a Todai account. It includes Gmail, which allows you to use your Todai email address (xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp); Google Drive, a file storage service; Google Docs, a document creation service; Google Spreadsheet, a spreadsheet service; Google Forms, a form creation service; YouTube, a video distribution service, and Google Meet, a web conference service. If you create a Todai account, you can set up a sharing setting that allows you to publish only to Todai accounts (limited publication), which is not possible with a regular Google account.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_microsoft %}This license allows you to use Microsoft's systems with a Todai account and download Microsoft Office applications such as Word and Excel, as well as their web versions, Office Online and OneNote. As with Google, you can set up a sharing setting (limited access) that allows only Todai accounts to access the site.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_utokyo_wifi %}This is a Wi-Fi service provided on campus. It allows access to campus-only databases and e-journals. Please note that you cannot use this service unless you have created an account in advance.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_eccs %}These are computers installed on campus. They provide access to campus-only databases and electronic journals. Faculty and staff are required to complete procedures in advance to use these terminals.{% endcapture %}

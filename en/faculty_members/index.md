## Introduction

To all new faculty members of the University of Tokyo,

In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, our university has introduced online classes since the 2020 academic year. In this 2021 academic year, we will begin hybrid educational activities and incorporate face-to-face classes as much as possible after taking sufficient infection prevention measures.

We received positive feedback from students last year in a survey regarding their online learning experiences, owing to the effort spared on lesson delivery and other considerations. It is reported that certain features and educational effects, in which face-to-face instruction lacks, are realized in online classes. We will continue to strive for excellence in online teaching in the academic year 2021/22. 

In this portal, we have made appropriate preparations to realize better online classes and to utilize our past experiences to achieve higher educational effect, making full use of the  feedback, requests and ideas from students and faculty members of the University of Tokyo. 

Regarding online classes, we have selected the Good Practices for 2020 and are sharing them among faculty members on this site. Please refer to this site for information on how to create effective online classes. We hope that you will find the information useful and meaningful to your educational activities. To help students achieve their academic goals and live a fulfilling life through teaching and learning activities, your understanding and cooperation is mostly appreciated.

## Types of Classes and Their Handling

### Types of Classes

{% include en/courses.md %}

### Institutional Handling of Classes

Institutionally, classes are categorized into **"face-to-face"** and **"remote" classes.** Undergraduate students are only allowed to include up to 60 credits of "remote classes" for graduation requirements. Therefore, the category of a course is a critical matter for students.

※2020年度・2021年度のオンライン授業については，特例的な措置として，60単位に算入しません．

- Classes institutionally categorized into **"face-to-face classes"** are classes that "provide the opportunity to attend class in person for at least half of the total class hours for all students (enrolled in the relevant course)."
    - Of the class types mentioned earlier, "face-to-face (complete face-to-face)" and also "face-to-face with synchronous online delivery (hybrid)" are usually institutionally categorized into "face-to-face classes."
- Classes institutionally categorized into **"remote classes"** are classes that do not fall under "face-to-face classes."
    - Of the class types mentioned earlier, "online (synchronous online type)" and "on-demand (asynchronous online type)" are institutionally categorized into "remote classes."
- If classes are held "face-to-face" (including “face-to-face with synchronous online delivery”) and "online" within a single course ("face-to-face/online hybrid type"), the class category ("face-to-face classes" or "remote classes") will be determined depending on the total class hours of each class type.

各授業形態の制度上の取扱いに関する詳細は，[「対面とオンラインを併用した授業実施形態にかかる取扱いの判断基準等について」（教職員専用）](https://univtokyo.sharepoint.com/sites/utokyoportal/wiki/SiteAssets/d/UTAS/%E5%AF%BE%E9%9D%A2%E3%81%A8%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%92%E4%BD%B5%E7%94%A8%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F%E6%8E%88%E6%A5%AD%E5%AE%9F%E6%96%BD%E5%BD%A2%E6%85%8B%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8B%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8B%E5%8F%96%E6%89%B1%E3%81%84%E3%81%AE%E5%88%A4%E6%96%AD%E5%9F%BA%E6%BA%96%E7%AD%89%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6_20220214%E4%BD%9C%E6%88%90.pdf)をご参照ください．

## Troubleshooting: Technical Support Desk

If you have any problems or need advice on using information systems, please consult the **[Technical Support Desk](/en/support/)**. The Technical Support Desk provides consultation services through three tools: chat, Zoom, and email form. The Technical Support Desk will respond quickly through the collaboration of student staff "Common Supporters" and faculty members.

## Getting Started: Initial Setup of the Common ID “UTokyo Account”

“UTokyo Account” is the account used for logging in to UTokyo’s IT systems, such as Zoom and ITC-LMS (which are explained later). Its username is also called “Common ID.”

The following is an explanation of the UTokyo Account’s initial setup procedure. Please read this section carefully, as it is an important procedure necessary for using UTokyo’s systems.

### Changing the Initial Password

1. Receive the “Notification regarding password for the UTokyo Account,” which includes your initial password, from your faculty, and graduate school. Faculty members who need it for classes should receive the notification, but if not, please contact your department's office.
2. Please log in to the [UTokyo Account User Menu](https://utacm.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/webmtn/LoginServlet) with the username and password indicated in the notification.
3. Click "Password Change" on the upper left to change your password. For the safety of your account, please set a strong password.

At this point, you will be able to log in to UTokyo’s systems including [UTAS](https://utas.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/campusweb/campusportal.do), which is used to input syllabi and grades. (*For information on how to use UTAS, please check with your department’s academic affairs office, or log in to UTAS, then click “Other” in the menu at the top of the screen and download the manual from the “Download Center.”)

### Setting up “Multi-Factor Authentication”

To improve the security of UTokyo’s IT systems, the “multi-factor authentication” (MFA) is available for UTokyo Accounts.

The MFA is a security process in which users prove their identity by at least two pieces of evidence. In addition to passwords, users are asked to verify their identity via SMS, authentication applications, and other methods when signing in to their accounts.

MFA setup is not mandatory at this time, but it is recommended for better security of your UTokyo Account. Please follow the setup procedures in the “**[Using Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts](/en/utokyo_account/mfa/)**” page.

## Using Zoom

Zoom is a simultaneous interactive web conferencing system, and is one of the most frequently used tools in online classes. There are other conferencing systems that perform similar functions, but if there is no particular reason, we recommend you use Zoom as it is a familiar tool for students.

### Signing in to Zoom

The University of Tokyo has a license agreement with Zoom, and by signing in and using it, you can hold meetings with a maximum capacity of 300 participants and for a 30-hour duration.

{% include en/zoom_signin_browser.md %}

The app has a different sign-in procedure than that of the browser. Please refer to the [Zoom sign-in procedure page](https://utelecon.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/zoom/zoom_signin) for more information (please note that you cannot sign in with more than one PCs/tablets/smartphones at the same time; however, you can sign in with one PC, one tablet, and one smartphone simultaneously).

### Creating a Meeting Room

Below are the steps for setting up a Zoom meeting room.

1. Sign in to Zoom, and click "Schedule a Meeting" in the top right corner.
2. The meeting setup page will appear.
    - Enter the name (title) of the meeting room in the "Topic" field.
    - Enter the date, time, and duration of the meeting. If you check the "Recurring meeting" checkbox, you can hold classes multiple times in one meeting room (without changing the URL).
    - Please be cautious of enabling “Require authentication to join” to restrict access to a meeting room, especially at the beginning of the new semester, because some students have not set up their UTokyo account. For more details, please see "[Restricting Access to Zoom Meeting Rooms for Online Classes](/en/faculty_members/zoom_access_control)."
3. Click “Save.” You will be directed to a page where you can confirm the details of the meeting room you have set up. The meeting room URL will be displayed in the "Invite Link" section. Participants can enter the room using this URL.

### Detailed Instructions

For detailed instructions on how to use Zoom, please refer to the **[Zoom page on this site](/en/zoom/)**.

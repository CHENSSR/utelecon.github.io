## Introduction

To all new faculty members of the University of Tokyo,

In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, our university has introduced online classes since the 2020 academic year. In this 2021 academic year, we will begin hybrid educational activities and incorporate face-to-face classes as much as possible after taking sufficient infection prevention measures.

We received positive feedback from students last year in a survey regarding their online learning experiences, owing to the effort spared on lesson delivery and other considerations. It is reported that certain features and educational effects, in which face-to-face instruction lacks, are realized in online classes. We will continue to strive for excellence in online teaching in the academic year 2021/22. 

In this portal, we have made appropriate preparations to realize better online classes and to utilize our past experiences to achieve higher educational effect, making full use of the  feedback, requests and ideas from students and faculty members of the University of Tokyo. 

Regarding online classes, we have selected the Good Practices for 2020 and are sharing them among faculty members on this site. Please refer to this site for information on how to create effective online classes. We hope that you will find the information useful and meaningful to your educational activities. To help students achieve their academic goals and live a fulfilling life through teaching and learning activities, your understanding and cooperation is mostly appreciated.

## Types of Classes and Their Handling

### Types of Classes

{% include en/courses.md %}

### Institutional Handling of Classes

Institutionally, classes are categorized into **"face-to-face"** and **"remote" classes.** Undergraduate students are only allowed to include up to 60 credits of "remote classes" for graduation requirements. Therefore, the category of a course is a critical matter for students.

※2020年度・2021年度のオンライン授業については，特例的な措置として，60単位に算入しません．

- Classes institutionally categorized into **"face-to-face classes"** are classes that "provide the opportunity to attend class in person for at least half of the total class hours for all students (enrolled in the relevant course)."
    - Of the class types mentioned earlier, "face-to-face (complete face-to-face)" and also "face-to-face with synchronous online delivery (hybrid)" are usually institutionally categorized into "face-to-face classes."
- Classes institutionally categorized into **"remote classes"** are classes that do not fall under "face-to-face classes."
    - Of the class types mentioned earlier, "online (synchronous online type)" and "on-demand (asynchronous online type)" are institutionally categorized into "remote classes."
- If classes are held "face-to-face" (including “face-to-face with synchronous online delivery”) and "online" within a single course ("face-to-face/online hybrid type"), the class category ("face-to-face classes" or "remote classes") will be determined depending on the total class hours of each class type.

### List of information systems

The following is a list of information systems operated and contracted by the University of Tokyo that are necessary for online classes, including learning management systems (systems for distributing class materials and collecting assignments), web conference systems, and cloud services. These systems have functions suitable for classroom use, such as the ability to hold meetings and share files only with University of Tokyo accounts, and students are accustomed to using these systems, so we recommend that you use these systems for your classes. The procedures for preparing an account are explained in detail in this document.

{% capture about_utokyo_account %}This is an account called "common ID" used in the University of Tokyo's information systems. You will use this account to log in to each system.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_utas %}This is the system used to register syllabi, grades, etc.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_itc_lms %}This is a system for distributing class materials and collecting assignments (learning management system), similar to UTAS, but UTAS is mainly used before (syllabus registration) and after (grade registration) classes start, while ITC-LMS is mainly used during classes.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_google %}This is a Google system (G Suite for Education) that can be used with a Todai account. It includes Gmail, which allows you to use your Todai email address (xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp); Google Drive, a file storage service; Google Docs, a document creation service; Google Spreadsheet, a spreadsheet service; Google Forms, a form creation service; YouTube, a video distribution service, and Google Meet, a web conference service. If you create a Todai account, you can set up a sharing setting that allows you to publish only to Todai accounts (limited publication), which is not possible with a regular Google account.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_microsoft %}This license allows you to use Microsoft's systems with a Todai account and download Microsoft Office applications such as Word and Excel, as well as their web versions, Office Online and OneNote. As with Google, you can set up a sharing setting (limited access) that allows only Todai accounts to access the site.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_utokyo_wifi %}This is a Wi-Fi service provided on campus. It allows access to campus-only databases and e-journals. Please note that you cannot use this service unless you have created an account in advance.{% endcapture %}
{% capture about_eccs %}These are computers installed on campus. They provide access to campus-only databases and electronic journals. Faculty and staff are required to complete procedures in advance to use these terminals.{% endcapture %}

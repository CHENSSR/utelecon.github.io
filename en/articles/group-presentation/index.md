title: Preparing a Group Presentation Online
---

## Highlights of This Article

In college classes, students often have the opportunity to give group presentations. It is now common to prepare for such presentations online, but this requires a variety of skills and techniques that differ from those required for face-to-face presentations. In this article, we will introduce a method for efficiently preparing online group presentations, based on the scenario of a group of students giving a presentation in class.  

Many students, especially at the University of Tokyo, may be experiencing group presentations for the first time in the Junior Division of the College of Arts and Sciences, such as in language classes. Please use this article as a reference to get an idea of what to expect before the presentation, and to prepare for the actual presentation.  

This article uses a slide presentation as a model case. You may refer to this article for other types of presentations, such as those using handouts, and apply the information in sections that you find helpful.  

## Sample Workflow

This article describes how to prepare and present an actual presentation using a slide presentation as a model case, following the flow below.  

1. Preparation
2. 1st meeting: Deciding the slide content
3. Preparing slides and other materials on your own
4. 2nd meeting: Preparing the presentation
5. Making the actual presentation

### 1. Preparation

#### Assigning roles

To ensure efficient preparation of the presentation, it is advisable to assign roles such as a leader, schedule manager, or record-keeper.  

#### Tools used to prepare a presentation

The following tools may be useful in preparing and presenting your presentation. Please note that all group members need to have access to the same tools.  

* Document sharing tools
* Presentation tools
* Meeting tools

Google Drive is the main tool for sharing materials. Google Drive is especially convenient for UTokyo members because it can be used with a Google account granted by the university. When sharing materials in a group, you can create a shared folder and save your presentation drafts and meeting minutes there to efficiently share and edit materials.  

It is also convenient if all members of the group can edit the materials together. For details, please refer to the following article. (Reference: [How to use Google Drive](/en/articles/google-drive/))  

PowerPoint and Google Slides are useful tools for creating presentation slides. Both tools have collaborative editing functions that allow multiple people, not just the file owner, to discuss and edit together. For example, Google Slides can be used for sharing drafts, while PowerPoint can be used for the final details. Using the collaborative editing function when creating slides allows you to "talk" and "create" at the same time, making slide creation more efficient.  

Zoom is the primary meeting tool for online meetings. It is a good idea to take minutes and record the meeting to keep a record of what was discussed and decided on during the meeting. When taking minutes, it is a good idea to use a tool with collaborative editing capabilities, such as Google Docs (see below for more information on taking minutes).  

There are many other tools available for online group work, so it is important to choose the one that best suits your needs. Please refer to [this article](/articles/student-communication/) for a summary of the features of various tools.  

#### Schedule adjustment

First, check how much time you have to prepare until the day of your presentation.  

In preparation for that presentation, it is a good idea to hold multiple meetings (this article assumes that two meetings will be held).  

The tools described in this article should be useful for managing the schedule.  

#### Ensuring means of communication
Make sure you have established a means of communication between the group beforehand.  

Depending on the size of the group and the type of class, it may be a good idea to utilize different tools such as LINE or Slack.  

### 2. Conducting the first meeting 

Once the dates have been arranged, the next step is to hold the meeting. Here is an example of how a meeting should proceed.  

This is just an example, so please adjust the content and order as necessary.  

#### Preparing minutes

A lively meeting is of little use if ideas and decisions are forgotten after the meeting is over.  

To prevent this, it is recommended to record the minutes of the discussion.  

An efficient way is to use Google Docs (or other tools that can be edited jointly by all group members) and share the screen while writing in real-time.  

Zoom's recording function can save the shared screen in video format, so it is also a good idea to use it in combination with Google Docs.

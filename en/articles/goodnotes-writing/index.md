## Basic Information
{:#basic_info}

GoodNotes 5 is a note-taking/drawing application that allows you to annotate imported slides and documents (PDF, Power Point, Word, etc.) with your handwriting. By using it in combination with Zoom, you can conduct lectures while handwriting on the board.

GoodNotes 5 can be used on an iPad, iPhone, or Mac, but we recommend using it on an iPad when writing on the board. The small screen size of an iPhone makes it difficult to write detailed notes on the board, even with a stylus. Likewise, it is possible to write on the board with a Mac with a separately purchased graphic tablet, but it is not possible to write by  directly touching the screen like on an iPad.

You can purchase this app from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/goodnotes-5/id1444383602#?platform=ipad).

This article provides information on how to use GoodNotes 5 on iPads using Apple Pencil (sold separately).

Note: Apple Pencil is the genuine Apple stylus and is only compatible with iPad. As of November 2021, Apple Pencil is not compatible with iPhone or Mac.

By double-tapping the Highlighter icon, an option menu with the option “Draw in Straight Line” will appear as shown in the image below. If it is enabled, lines you draw will be straightened automatically even if it is slightly blurred.

As with the Pen tool, you can change the color and the thickness of the Highlighter, as shown in the images below.

### Shape tool

When the tool is used to draw an eclipse, circle, rectangle, triangle, etc. It will automatically correct the shape to a close match, as shown in the image below.

(Example) The image below shows the lasso tool moving an ellipse created with the Shape tool. The lasso tool is selecting the ellipse by circling it.

Two types of pointers are available: one is a pointer that follows the touch operation, while the other displays a trail that remains after the touch operation until the Apple Pencil is released from the screen.

      <li><strong>Menus, such as "ECCS Cloud Email (password)", do not appear in the ECCS User Menu</strong>: This happens when you access the site before the initial password change for your UTokyo Account is reflected in the system. Please wait for approximately 10 minutes for the change to be reflected and try again.</li>
      <li><strong>Error message “EX-076 An error has occurred. EX-079 It can't be set for New Password because the Directory already has the same attribute value."</strong>: This message appears due to restrictions on ECCS Cloud Email passwords which require the password to be different from the old password and not contain any part of the password or username (10-digit number) of your UTokyo Account. Please change your password accordingly to avoid this error message.</li>
